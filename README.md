This is just another brand new toy project, 
I decided to remake one of my projects in 2019 as I remember, 
which was originally built using vanilla javascript,
Express.js, bootstrap 4, css and html as well
I decided to remake the project with typescript 
and react js is pretty much easy specially in the beginning, but
to be honest, I'm not very familiar
with typescript even though it does not 
make much difference as person who use statically-typed language like java, C++, Swift or even Kotlin,
but I follow coding in flow since he 
was creating videos in Android and Xml and I like how he explain things, so
I decided to follow along with his mern video

In the end typescript compile to JavaScript code
